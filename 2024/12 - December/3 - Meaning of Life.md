<h1>What is the Meaning of Life ?</h1>

<h2>The answer is:</h2>

At the start, there is no meaning. As our life progresses & our experiences grow, we will eventually know a lot and <b>understand</b> what 'life' is.

<h2>The right word is:</h2>

All-in! (in the participation of 'life', for the wonderful experiences)


<h2>The golden quote is:</h2>

You shouldn't be intentional all the time, do things that will make you want to wake up early the next day. Avoid pressure & be brave, be simple!
